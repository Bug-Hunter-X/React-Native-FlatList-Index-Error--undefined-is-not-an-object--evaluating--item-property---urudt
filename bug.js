This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to access the item using index in renderItem. This happens when the data source changes and the index is no longer valid. For example, if you're filtering or sorting the data, the index of an item might change, leading to the error.  This is especially true if the FlatList is re-rendered with different data, causing the index to mismatch the actual data item. This results in undefined being passed as the parameter to the component.
