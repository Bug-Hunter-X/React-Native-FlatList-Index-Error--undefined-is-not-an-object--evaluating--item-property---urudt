This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component and provides a solution. The error arises when the index used to access items in renderItem becomes invalid after modifying the data source (e.g., filtering, sorting). The solution uses the item object directly rather than relying on index to avoid this issue.  This ensures that data consistency is maintained even when data changes cause re-rendering.
